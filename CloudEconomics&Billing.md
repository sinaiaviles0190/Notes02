# Cloud Economics and Billing
## Notes 2
### Key Points
#### Pay as you go pricing
- AWS Pricing is similar to electricity bills; only pay for what you use.
#### Three Fundamentals of Pricing
- Compute
- Storage
- Outbound Data Transfer
#### AWS
- On demand services means you pay for database capacity
- Dedicated Instances run in a private cloud on hardware for a single customer
- Spot Instances are Amazon EC2 that lets you purchase spare computer capacity and gives you discounted hourly rates
- Reservations allow you to recieve a greater discount by paying ahead of time
#### TCO ( Total Cost of Ownership )
- What to take into consideration: Prices of cloud computing and the benefits you will recieve depends on the business/organization you are. Infrastructure costs must be taken into consideration as well. Total cost of the cloud services when in use, cost of hiring skilled staff and the cost of migration. 
- Cost of technology like downtime, training, electricity, installation and support
